# Evidentia: Secure Digital Document Management System (26190)

(Prototype) 


<img src="/images/adminlandingpage.png" alt="an image of the admin page>




Two services, run independently: 

See each service's own README for setup and details. This file covers the problem being solved, how the two services fit together, and how to build and run the whole thing.

## Problem Statement

**PS ID:** SIH26190
**Title:** Secure Digital Document Management System for Legal and Investigation Documents
**Organization:** Ministry of Home Affairs
**Department:** National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB), Women Safety Division
**Category:** Software
**Theme:** Blockchain & Cybersecurity

Law enforcement agencies, courts, legal departments, and investigative organizations handle large volumes of sensitive documents across a case lifecycle, including FIRs, investigation records, witness statements, charge sheets, court filings, evidence records, and forensic reports. Many organizations still rely on paper based or fragmented digital storage, which causes slow document retrieval, unauthorized access risk, tampering risk, no version control, poor inter department collaboration, and weak auditability.

## Proposed Solution

We are building a Secure Digital Document Management System (DMS) that lets authorized personnel securely store, organize, retrieve, and share legal and investigation documents tied to a case.

Core capabilities for the prototype:

- Role based access control, so only authorized roles can view or act on a given document
- Centralized document upload and storage with case level metadata
- A full audit trail that records who viewed, uploaded, or modified a document, and when
- Search and filter of documents by case ID, document type, and date

How it addresses the problem:

- Replaces fragmented, paper based storage with a single system of record per case
- Enforces access control at the API layer instead of relying on manual, physical restriction
- Makes every document interaction traceable, which directly targets the auditability gap named in the problem statement
- Lays the groundwork for tamper evidence and version history as the system matures beyond the prototype

Innovation and uniqueness:

- The audit log is a first class part of the data model, not an afterthought bolted on later
- The architecture separates the system of record from the reporting and oversight layer, so investigative staff and oversight/admin staff interact with purpose built interfaces instead of one generic dashboard

## Tamper detection using local Ethereum

The prototype now includes a tamper-evidence layer using **Ganache**, a local Ethereum virtual network, and a small **Solidity** smart contract. The blockchain stores a trusted hash of each uploaded document so the system can later detect whether the stored file has been altered.

How it works:

- When a document is uploaded, Spring Boot reads the file bytes and computes a **SHA-3 hash**
- The document ID, hash, case ID, uploader address, and timestamp are stored by the `DocumentRegistry` smart contract on Ganache
- The document itself remains in the local document store and is not placed on the blockchain
- `GET /api/documents/{id}/verify` reads the current file, recomputes its SHA-3 hash, retrieves the original hash from the smart contract, and compares the two
- If the hashes match, the document is reported as intact; if they differ, the document is reported as potentially altered since upload

The Solidity contract exposes `storeDocumentHash` for anchoring a document hash and `getDocumentRecord` for retrieving the stored record. Spring Boot interacts with the contract through **Web3j**.

Ganache is used as a local single-node Ethereum environment for the prototype. It provides a controlled blockchain environment for development and demonstration without requiring a public Ethereum network. This is intentionally a tamper-evidence mechanism rather than a claim that the overall system is tamper-proof.

This implementation is a deliberate simplification of a distributed blockchain deployment. A single local Ethereum node is sufficient for demonstrating hash anchoring and verification within the scope and timeline of the prototype.

## How the two services talk to each other

Communication is one directional. The Django dashboard calls the Spring Boot REST API over HTTP. Django has no direct database access to Spring Boot's data, and Spring Boot has no dependency on Django at all, it can run and be fully tested on its own. 


## Contract between the two services

Django's `api_client.py` was originally built against a stubbed version of this contract before the real Spring Boot endpoints existed, so it could be developed in parallel. The two are now aligned on:

| Endpoint | Purpose | Access |
|---|---|---|
| `POST /api/auth/register` | Create a user | Open |
| `POST /api/auth/login` | Verify credentials, return a token | Open |
| `GET /api/documents` | List documents (role filtered) | Authenticated |
| `POST /api/documents` | Upload a document | Authenticated |
| `GET /api/documents/{id}` | View one document | Authenticated, owner or ADMIN |
| `GET /api/cases` | List case summaries (derived, not a real entity) | ADMIN |
| `GET /api/cases/{caseId}` | Single case detail | ADMIN |
| `GET /api/audit-log` | Full or filtered audit trail | ADMIN |
| `GET /api/documents/{id}/verify` | Verify current file against the on-chain hash | Authenticated, owner or ADMIN |

Field names in every response are chosen to match what `dashboard/api_client.py` and the Django templates already expect (`documentId`, `title`, `uploadedBy`, `auditId`, `performedBy`, `performedAt`, etc), not Spring Boot's internal naming, so no translation layer is needed on the Django side.

## How to build

### 1. Spring Boot service (system of record)

**Requirements:** Java 17+, Maven, PostgreSQL running locally, Node.js/npm, and Ganache.

1. Install and start **Ganache**:
   - Install Ganache locally and start a local Ethereum workspace/network
   - Keep the RPC endpoint and funded account details available, as Spring Boot will use them to deploy and call the smart contract

2. Install the Solidity compiler used by the project:
```bash
   npm install solc@0.8.19
```
   This creates the local Solidity toolchain used to compile `DocumentRegistry.sol`.

3. Compile the smart contract from the project root:
```bash
   npx solcjs --bin --abi \
     -o src/main/resources/solidity.DocumentRegistry \
     contracts/DocumentRegistry.sol
```
   The generated ABI and bytecode files should be available as:
```text
   src/main/resources/solidity.DocumentRegistry/DocumentRegistry.abi
   src/main/resources/solidity.DocumentRegistry/DocumentRegistry.bin
```

4. Configure `application.properties`:
   - Set the PostgreSQL username and password
   - Set the Ganache RPC URL
   - Set the **private key of the funded Ganache account** used by Web3j
   - Leave `blockchain.contract-address` blank for the first run if the application should deploy the contract automatically

5. Start Spring Boot once with the contract address blank. The application deploys `DocumentRegistry` to Ganache and prints the deployed contract address in the console.

6. Copy the deployed contract address into:
```properties
   blockchain.contract-address=0x...
```
   Then restart Spring Boot so subsequent uploads and verification calls use the deployed contract.

7. Create the database:
```bash
   createdb dms_db
```
   or from inside `psql`:
```sql
   CREATE DATABASE dms_db;
```
8. Copy the properties template and fill in your real local credentials:
```bash
   cd spring-boot-service/src/main/resources
   cp application.properties.example application.properties
```
   Then edit `application.properties` and set `spring.datasource.username` / `spring.datasource.password` to your local Postgres user.
9. Build and run:
```bash
   cd spring-boot-service
   mvn clean install
   mvn spring-boot:run
```
   Runs on `http://localhost:8080`.

10. Verify the blockchain-backed tamper detection:
   - Upload a document through `POST /api/documents`
   - Note the returned `documentId`
   - Verify it through `GET /api/documents/{id}/verify`
   - A matching file should return the successful integrity message
   - To demonstrate tampering, modify the stored file after upload and run the same verification endpoint again. The recomputed hash will differ from the on-chain hash and the response will report that the file may have been altered

### 2. Django dashboard (reporting/oversight layer)

**Requirements:** Python 3.11+, pip.

```bash
cd django-service
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate        # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python manage.py migrate
```

Point it at the real Spring Boot API instead of stub data:
```bash
export DJANGO_USE_STUB_API=false
export SPRING_BOOT_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8080
```

Run it:
```bash
python manage.py runserver
```
Runs on `http://localhost:8000`.

### 3. Register your first users

The dashboard has no signup page, users are created directly against the Spring Boot API. Register at least one ADMIN, since `/api/cases` and `/api/audit-log` return 403 for an OFFICER, and you'll want both roles to test the dashboard's restricted-view handling:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/auth/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"username":"admin1","password":"adminpass","role":"ADMIN"}'

curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/auth/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"username":"officer1","password":"officerpass","role":"OFFICER"}'
```

Then log in through the dashboard at `http://localhost:8000` with either account.

## CRUD operations via curl

Reading data (cases, documents, audit log) is easiest through the dashboard once you're logged in, that's what it's for. The commands below cover Create and Read, plus document integrity verification.

### Create

**Register a user** (shown above), and **log in** to verify credentials directly:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"username":"officer1","password":"officerpass"}'
```

**Upload a document:**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/documents \
  -u officer1:officerpass \
  -F "file=@/path/to/some/file.pdf" \
  -F "caseId=CASE-001" \
  -F "documentType=FIR"
```

### Read (also available via curl, if you want to bypass the dashboard)

```bash
# List documents (role filtered)
curl -u officer1:officerpass http://localhost:8080/api/documents

# View one document
curl -u officer1:officerpass http://localhost:8080/api/documents/1

# Cases and audit log require an ADMIN account
curl -u admin1:adminpass http://localhost:8080/api/cases
curl -u admin1:adminpass http://localhost:8080/api/audit-log

# Verify document integrity against the hash stored on Ganache
curl -u officer1:officerpass http://localhost:8080/api/documents/1/verify
```

### Update and Delete

**Not implemented yet.** There is no `PUT`, `PATCH`, or `DELETE` endpoint anywhere in the current API, documents can be created and read, but not edited or removed once uploaded. This is an honest gap, not an oversight to gloss over, adding these (with corresponding audit log entries for `UPDATE`/`DELETE` actions) is on the task list below.

## Known gaps, honestly listed

- No real `Case` entity, `title` and `status` on case summaries are placeholders
- Blockchain integration currently uses a local Ganache network for the prototype; a distributed multi-validator deployment is not implemented
- No AI document analysis layer yet (deferred to after the presentation round)
- No upload form in the Django dashboard, uploads are tested via the Spring Boot API directly
- No Update or Delete endpoints for documents, only Create and Read exist
- The Django session stores the raw password for reuse as Basic Auth on later calls, acceptable for a localhost prototype, not something to carry into a real deployment
- `POST /api/auth/login`'s "token" is a Basic Auth string, not a real bearer token, a deliberate simplification given the timeline

## Implementation Tasks

### Spring Boot service
- [x] Core entities, RBAC, document upload/retrieval, audit logging
- [x] `/api/cases`, `/api/audit-log`, `/api/auth/login` to match the Django contract
- [ ] Update and Delete endpoints for documents, with matching audit log entries
- [x] On-chain (Ganache/Web3j) tamper-evidence and document hash verification layer
- [ ] Real `Case` entity if time allows

### Django service
- [x] Case overview, case detail, document list, audit log pages, built against stub data
- [x] Real login page, session-based auth, logout, per-session credentials used on every API call
- [x] Graceful handling when an OFFICER session hits an ADMIN-only endpoint (restricted notice instead of a crash)
- [ ] Switch to live Spring Boot data and verify all four pages render correctly
- [ ] Upload form calling `POST /api/documents`

### Later, after the presentation round
- [ ] LLM-based document analysis (summarization, detail extraction)
- [ ] Document version history
